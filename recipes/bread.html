         <p style="width: 500px;">Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour (usually wheat) and water, 
            usually by baking. Throughout recorded history and around the world, 
            it has been an important part of many cultures' diet. 
            It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance since the 
            dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and 
            secular culture.</p>
